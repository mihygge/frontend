                    <h4>Scope of miHygge Services</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The miHygge Platform is an online marketplace that enables registered users (“Members”) and certain third parties who offer services (Members and third parties who offer services are “Providers” and the services they offer are “Provider Services”) to publish such Provider Services on the miHygge Platform (“Listings”) and to communicate and transact directly with Members that are seeking to book such Provider Services (Members using Provider Services are “Consumers”). Provider Services may include the offering of the following services:
                            <ul className="list-normal">
                                <li>“<strong>Care Services</strong>” generally consist of senior healthcare ( or non-healthcare )services. </li>
                                <li>“<strong>Accommodations</strong>” are senior housing and living arrangements which may be available to be rented, leased, shared by seniors. Accommodations generally include senior living facilities, assisted living spaces or other housing arrangements and may include specialized Care Services (such as hospice, non-hospice, respite, memory care, rehabilitation etc). References to  </li>
                                <li>“<strong>Experiences</strong>” include single or multi-day activities in various categories; and</li>
                                <li>“<strong>Events</strong>”, such as access to unique events and locations.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>As the provider of the miHygge Platform, miHygge does not own, create, sell, resell, provide, control, manage, offer, deliver, or supply any Listings or Provider Services. Providers alone are responsible for their Listings and Provider Services. When Members make or accept a booking, they are entering into a contract directly with each other. miHygge is not and does not become a party to or other participant in any contractual relationship between Members, nor is miHygge a health care broker or insurer. miHygge is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member.</li>
                        <li><strong>MIHYGGE DOES NOT, AND THE SERVICES ARE NOT INTENDED TO PROVIDE HEALTHCARE, OR FINANCIAL OR REAL ESTATE ADVICE.</strong> miHygge does not: (a) act as a real estate agent for you or any other user; (b) represent you or another user in the purchase, sale, or exchange of real property, including any negotiation thereof; or (c) lease or rent, offer to lease or rent, or negotiate the lease of real property or otherwise aid or assist in the lease of real property. miHygge assumes no responsibility for any result or consequence related directly or indirectly to any action or inaction that Consumers take based on the Services or any other information available through or in connection with the Services.</li>
                        <li>While we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes, miHygge has no control over and does not guarantee (i) the existence, quality, safety, suitability, or legality of any Listings or Provider Services, (ii) the truth or accuracy of any Listing descriptions, Ratings, Reviews, or other Member Content (as defined below), or (iii) the performance or conduct of any Member or third party. miHygge does not endorse any Member, Listing or Provider Services. Any references to a Member being “verified” (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification or identification process and nothing else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by miHygge about any Member, including of the Member’s identity or background or whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. You should always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to use a Care Service, stay in an Accommodation, participate in an Experience or Event or use other Provider Services, accept a booking request from a Consumer, or communicate and interact with other Members, whether online or in person. Images of Accommodations are intended only to indicate a photographic representation of a Listing at the time the photograph was taken, and are therefore not an endorsement by miHygge of any Provider or Listing.</li>
                        <li>If you choose to use the miHygge Platform as a Provider, your relationship with miHygge is limited to being an independent, third-party contractor, and not an employee, agent, joint venturer or partner of miHygge for any reason, and you act exclusively on your own behalf and for your own benefit, and not on behalf, or for the benefit, of miHygge.</li>
                        <li>The miHygge Platform may contain links to third-party websites or resources (“ <strong>Third-Party Services</strong>”). Such Third-Party Services may be subject to different terms and conditions and privacy practices. miHygge is not responsible or liable for the availability or accuracy of such Third-Party Services, or the content, products, or services available from such Third-Party Services. Links to such Third-Party Services are not an endorsement by miHygge of such Third-Party Services.</li>
                        <li>Due to the nature of the Internet, miHygge cannot guarantee the continuous and uninterrupted availability and accessibility of the miHygge Platform. miHygge may restrict the availability of the miHygge Platform or certain areas or features thereof, if this is necessary in view of capacity limits, the security or integrity of our servers, or to carry out maintenance measures that ensure the proper or improved functioning of the miHygge Platform.  miHygge may improve, enhance and modify the miHygge Platform and introduce new miHygge Services from time to time.</li>
                        <li>You acknowledge that although some Member Content may be provided by healthcare professionals, the provision of such Member/Content does not create a medical professional/patient relationship, and does not constitute an opinion, medical advice, or diagnosis or treatment, but is provided to assist you in choosing a care provider, doctor, or other healthcare specialist, professional, provider, or organization (collectively, “Service Provider”). </li>
                        <li>WHILE WE MAKE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO PROVIDE YOU WITH ACCURATE CONTENT, WE MAKE NO GUARANTEES, REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS, EXPERTISE, QUALITY OF WORK, PRICE OR COST INFORMATION, INSURANCE COVERAGE OR BENEFIT INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PROVIDER SERVICES. IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY DECISION MADE OR ACTION TAKEN BY YOU IN RELIANCE ON ANY SUCH CONTENT. FURTHERMORE, WE DO NOT IN ANY WAY ENDORSE OR RECOMMEND ANY INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY LISTED OR ACCESSIBLE THROUGH THE PROVIDER SERVICES.</li>

                        <li>User verification on the Internet is difficult and we do not assume any responsibility for the confirmation of any Member’s identity. Notwithstanding the above, for transparency and fraud prevention purposes, and as permitted by applicable laws, we may, but have no obligation to (i) ask Members to provide a form of government identification or other information or undertake additional checks designed to help verify the identities or backgrounds of Members, (ii) screen Members against third party databases or other sources and request reports from Providers, and (iii) where we have sufficient information to identify a Member, obtain reports from public records of criminal convictions or sex offender registrations or an equivalent version of background or registered sex offender checks in your local jurisdiction (if available).</li>
                        <li>The access to or use of certain areas and features of the miHygge Platform may be subject to separate policies, standards or guidelines, or may require that you accept additional terms and conditions. If there is a conflict between these Terms and terms and conditions applicable to a specific area or feature of the miHygge Platform, the latter terms and conditions will take precedence with respect to your access to or use of that area or feature, unless specified otherwise.</li>
                        <li>Some areas of the miHygge Platform implement Google Maps/Earth mapping services, including Google Maps API(s). Your use of Google Maps/Earth is subject to the Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service.</li>

                                <p>miHygge may charge fees to Providers (“Provider Fees”) and/or Consumers (“Consumer Fees”) (collectively, “Service Fees”) in consideration for the use of the miHygge Platform.

                            <p>Certain bookings may include features that allow for automatically recurring payments for periodic charges (“<strong>Subscription Service</strong>”).

The subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your subscription, or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic subscription fee to your account. We will bill the periodic subscription fee to the payment method you provide to us during registration (or to a different payment method if you change your payment information). miHygge may change the subscription fee for any subsequent subscription period but will provide you advance notice of any increase before it applies.</p>

In addition, you agree to pay, if requested by the Provider, for each twenty-four (24) hour period (or any portion thereof) that you Overstay, an additional nightly fee of up to two (2) times the average nightly Listing Fee originally paid by you to cover the inconvenience suffered by the Provider, plus all applicable Consumer Fees, Taxes, and any legal expenses incurred by the Provider to make you leave (collectively, “Overstay Fees”). Overstay Fees for late checkouts on the checkout date that do not impact upcoming bookings may be limited to the additional costs incurred by the Provider as a result of such Overstay.  miHygge will collect Overstay Fees from you pursuant to the Payments Terms. A Security Deposit, if required by a Provider, may be applied to any Overstay Fees due for a Consumer’s Overstay.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Providers and Consumers are responsible for any modifications to a booking that they make via the miHygge Platform or direct miHygge Consumer service to make (“<strong>Booking Modifications</strong>”), and agree to pay any additional Listing Fees, Provider Fees or Consumer Fees and/or Taxes associated with such Booking Modifications.</li>
                        <li>Consumers can cancel a confirmed booking within 72 hours  or 3 business days (whichever is later) of making the reservation subject to miHygge’s cancellation policy, and miHygge will provide any refund to the Consumer in accordance with such cancellation policy. Any amounts due to the Provider under the applicable cancellation policy will be remitted to the Provider by miHygge.</li>
                        <li>If a Provider cancels a confirmed booking, the Consumer will receive a full refund of the Total Fees for such booking and miHygge may publish an automated review on the Listing cancelled by the Provider indicating that a booking was cancelled. In addition, miHygge may (i) keep the calendar for the Listing unavailable or blocked for the dates of the cancelled booking, and/or (ii) impose a cancellation fee, unless the Provider has a valid reason for cancelling the booking pursuant to miHygge’s Consumer Refund Policy or has legitimate concerns about the Consumer’s behavior.</li>
                        <li>For Experiences, Events and other Provider Services, if inclement weather creates an unsafe or uncomfortable scenario for Consumers, Providers may modify or cancel a Provider Service. If there is a substantial change in the itinerary or the Provider Service needs to be cancelled, miHygge will work with the Provider to provide Consumers an alternative date for the Provider Service, an appropriate refund or a rebooking.</li>
                        <li>In certain circumstances, miHygge may decide, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary to cancel a confirmed booking and make appropriate refund and payout decisions. This may be for reasons set forth in miHygge’s Consumer Refund Policy or (i) where miHygge believes in good faith, while taking the legitimate interests of both parties into account, this is necessary to avoid significant harm to miHygge, other Members, third parties or property, or (ii) for any of the reasons set out in these Terms.</li>
                        <li>
                            If a Consumer suffers a Cancellation Event pursuant to the Consumer Refund Policy, miHygge may determine, in its sole discretion, to refund the Consumer part or all of the Total Fees in accordance with the Consumer Refund Policy.
                            <br />
                            In case of a situation, where two consumers are trying  to book the same bed at the same time, the first to arrive at the booking/payment page will be given priority and they have about a 10 minutes window to complete the booking. In case for some reason, the person is unable to complete the booking, the system will revert back the beds to it’s original status. The Consumer then has to restart the process of booking all over again.

                        <li>You agree to contact miHygge by using the “Contact Us” section of the miHygge Platform prior to sending or requesting money for refunds, additional Provider Services or Damage Claims related to bookings.

                        <li>As a Consumer, you are responsible for leaving the Accommodation (including any personal or other property located at the Accommodation) in the condition it was in when you arrived. You are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals whom you invite to, or otherwise provide access to, the Accommodation, excluding the Provider (and the individuals the Provider invites to the Accommodation, if applicable).</li>
                        <li>If a Provider claims and provides evidence that you as a Consumer have damaged an Accommodation or any personal or other property at an Accommodation (“Damage Claim”), the Provider can seek payment from you. If a Provider escalates a Damage Claim to miHygge, you will be given an opportunity to respond. If you as a Consumer (i) agree to pay the Provider in connection with a Damage Claim, or (ii) miHygge determines in its sole discretion that you are responsible for damaging an Accommodation or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation pursuant to the miHygge Terms, you authorize Payment Processor to charge the Payment Method used to make the booking in order to collect any Security Deposit associated with the Listing, as well as any amount of the Damage Claim exceeding any Security Deposit. If the Listing does not have a Security Deposit, Payment Processor may charge the Payment Method used to make the booking for the amount of the Damage Claim. If we are unable to collect from your Payment Method used to make the booking, you agree that Payment Processor may charge any other Payment Method on file (and not otherwise unauthorized) in your miHygge Account at the time of the Damage Claim. 
                            <br /><br /> miHygge also reserves the right to otherwise collect payment from you and pursue any remedies available to miHygge in this regard in situations in which you are responsible for a Damage Claim.

A Member shall, upon miHygge’s reasonable request and at no cost to the Member, participate in mediation or a similar resolution process with another Member, which process will be conducted by miHygge or a third party selected by miHygge or its insurer, with respect to losses for which a Member is requesting payment from miHygge (including but not limited to payments under the miHygge Provider Agreement).</li>
                        <li>If you are a Consumer, you understand and agree that miHygge may make a claim under your homeowner’s, renter’s or other insurance policy related to any damage or loss that you may have caused, or been responsible for, to an Accommodation or any personal or other property located at an Accommodation (including without limitation amounts paid by miHygge under the miHygge Provider Agreement).

                        <li>As a Provider you are solely responsible for determining your obligations to report, collect, remit or include in your Listing Fees any applicable good and services taxes or other indirect sales taxes, occupancy tax, or other visitor taxes or income taxes (“<storng>Taxes</storng>”).</li>
                        <li>Tax regulations may require us to collect appropriate Tax information from Providers, or to withhold Taxes from payouts to Providers, or both. If a Provider fails to provide us with documentation that we determine to be sufficient to alleviate our obligation (if any) to withhold Taxes from payouts to you, we reserve the right to freeze all payouts, withhold such amounts as required by law, or to do both, until resolution.</li>
                        <li>You understand that any appropriate governmental agency, department and/or authority (“<strong>Tax Authority</strong>”) where your Accommodation is located may require Taxes to be collected from Consumers or Providers on Listing Fees, and to be remitted to the respective Tax Authority. The laws in jurisdictions may vary, but these Taxes may be required to be collected and remitted as a percentage of the Listing Fees set by Providers, a set amount per day, or other variations, and are sometimes called “transient occupancy taxes,” “hotel taxes,” “lodging taxes,” “city taxes,” “room taxes” or “tourist taxes” (“<strong>Occupancy Taxes</strong>”).</li>
                        <li>In certain jurisdictions, miHygge may decide in its sole discretion to facilitate collection and remittance of Occupancy Taxes from or on behalf of Consumers or Providers, in accordance these Terms (“<strong>Collection and Remittance</strong>”) if such jurisdiction asserts miHygge or Providers have an Occupancy Tax collection and remittance obligation. In any jurisdiction in which we decide to facilitate direct Collection and Remittance, you hereby instruct and authorize miHygge (via Payment Processor) to collect Occupancy Taxes from Consumers on the Provider’s behalf at the time Listing Fees are collected, and to remit such Occupancy Taxes to the Tax Authority. The amount of Occupancy Taxes, if any, collected and remitted by miHygge will be visible to and separately stated to both Consumers and Providers on their respective transaction documents. Where miHygge is facilitating Collection and Remittance, Providers are not permitted to collect any Occupancy Taxes being collected by miHygge relating to their Accommodations in that jurisdiction.</li>
                        <li>You agree that any claim or cause of action relating to miHygge’s facilitation of Collection and Remittance of Occupancy Taxes shall not extend to any supplier or vendor that may be used by miHygge in connection with facilitation of Collection and Remittance, if any. Consumers and Providers agree that we may seek additional amounts from you in the event that the Taxes collected and/or remitted are insufficient to fully discharge your obligations to the Tax Authority, and agree that your sole remedy for Occupancy Taxes collected is a refund of Occupancy Taxes collected by miHygge from the applicable Tax Authority in accordance with applicable procedures set by that Tax Authority.</li>
                        <li>miHygge reserves the right, with prior notice to Providers, to cease the Collection and Remittance in any jurisdiction for any reason at which point Providers and Consumers are once again solely responsible and liable for the collection and/or remittance of any and all Occupancy Taxes that may apply to Accommodations in that jurisdiction.</li>

                    <h4>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement shall apply if you (i) reside in the United States; or (ii) do not reside in the United States, but bring any claim against miHygge in the United States (to the extent not in conflict with Section 21).</li>
                        <li>
                            <span>Overview of Dispute Resolution Process.  miHygge is committed to participating in a Consumer-friendly dispute resolution process. To that end, these Terms provide for a two-part process for individuals to whom Section 19.1 applies: (1) an informal negotiation directly with miHygge’s Consumer service team, and (2) a binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) using its specially designed Consumer Arbitration Rules (as modified by this Section 19). Specifically, the Consumer Arbitration Rules provide:</span>
                            <ul className="list-normal">
                                <li>Claims can be filed with AAA online (www.adr.org);</li>
                                <li>Arbitrators must be neutral and no party may unilaterally select an arbitrator;</li>
                                <li>Arbitrators must disclose any bias, interest in the result of the arbitration, or relationship with any party;</li>
                                <li>Parties retain the right to seek relief in small claims court for certain claims, at their option;</li>
                                <li>The initial filing fee for the Consumer is capped at $200;</li>
                                <li>The Consumer gets to elect the hearing location and can elect to participate live, by phone, video conference or, for claims under $25,000, by the submission of documents;</li>
                                <li>The arbitrator can grant any remedy that the parties could have received in court to resolve the party’s individual claim.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification. Prior to initiating an arbitration, you and miHygge each agree to notify the other party of the dispute and attempt to negotiate an informal resolution to it first. We will contact you at the email address you have provided to us; you can contact miHygge’s Consumer service team by emailing us. If after a good faith effort to negotiate one of us feels the dispute has not and cannot be resolved informally, the party intending to pursue arbitration agrees to notify the other party via email prior to initiating the arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, a claim must be filed with the AAA and the written Demand for Arbitration (available at www.adr.org) provided to the other party, as specified in the AAA Rules.</li>
                        <li>Agreement to Arbitrate. You and miHygge mutually agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement or interpretation thereof, or to the use of the miHygge Platform, the Provider Services, or the Collective Content (collectively, “<strong>Disputes</strong>”) will be settled by binding arbitration (the “<strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>”). If there is a dispute about whether this Arbitration Agreement can be enforced or applies to our Dispute, you and miHygge agree that the arbitrator will decide that issue.</li>
                        <li>Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement. You and miHygge each agree that the following claims are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction: (i) Any claim related to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; (ii) Any claim seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack).</li>
                        <li>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law. This Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitration will be administered by AAA in accordance with the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified here. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at AAA: 1–800–778–7879.</li>
                        <li>Modification to AAA Rules - Arbitration Hearing/Location. In order to make the arbitration most convenient to you, miHygge agrees that any required arbitration hearing may be conducted, at your option, (a) in the county where you reside; (b) in San Francisco County; (c) in any other location to which you and miHygge both agree; (d) via phone or video conference; or (e) for any claim or counterclaim under $25,000, by solely the submission of documents to the arbitrator.</li>
                        <li>Modification of AAA Rules - Attorney’s Fees and Costs. You may be entitled to seek an award of attorney fees and expenses if you prevail in arbitration, to the extent provided under applicable law and the AAA rules. Unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous or filed for the purpose of harassment, miHygge agrees it will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law or the AAA rules, to recover attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</li>
                        <li>Arbitrator’s Decision. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with proper jurisdiction. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim.</li>
                        <li>Jury Trial Waiver. You and miHygge acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable Disputes.</li>
                        <li>No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings. You and miHygge acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general action, or any other representative proceeding as to all Disputes. Further, unless you and miHygge both otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this paragraph is held unenforceable with respect to any Dispute, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement will be deemed void with respect to such Dispute.</li>
                        <li>Severability. Except as provided in Section 19.11, in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given full force and effect.</li>
                        <li>Changes. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3 (“<strong>Modification of these Terms</strong>”), if miHygge changes this Section 19 (“<strong>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement</strong>”) after the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email) within thirty (30) days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of miHygge’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and miHygge in accordance with the provisions of the “Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement” section as of the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</li>
                        <li>Survival. Except as provided in Section 19.12 and subject to Section 15.8, this Section 19 will survive any termination of these Terms and will continue to apply even if you stop using the miHygge Platform or terminate your miHygge Account.</li>
